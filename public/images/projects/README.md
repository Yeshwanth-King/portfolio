## How to Add Screenshots:

1. **Take Screenshots**: Visit your live projects and take high-quality screenshots
2. **Resize if needed**: Use tools like Photoshop, GIMP, or online resizers to get 600x400px
3. **Save with exact names**: Use the exact filenames listed above
4. **Place in this folder**: Put the images directly in `/public/images/projects/`

## Tips for Good Screenshots:

- **Show the main interface**: Capture the most important part of your app
- **Use good lighting**: Make sure the screenshot is clear and well-lit
- **Remove sensitive data**: Blur or remove any personal/sensitive information
- **Show key features**: Try to capture the main functionality of your project
- **Consistent sizing**: Keep all images the same size for a uniform look

## Fallback:

If you don't have screenshots yet, the portfolio will show placeholder images until you add the real ones.
